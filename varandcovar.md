Listing basic terminologies of Statistics required for Machine Learning.
## Variance

It is the measure of the spread of the data around it’s mean value. 
The variance of a random variable X, with mean $$EX=μX$$
is defined as  $$Var(X)=E[(X−μX)^{2}]$$
Larger the variance, the distribution of data is higher.

## Covariance:
The relationship between two variables X and Y. It tells us how the data is spread relative to each other.
The covariance between X and Y is defined as
$$Cov(X,Y)=E[(X−E(X))(Y−E(Y))]=E[XY]−(E(X))(E(Y))$$
          $$=E[(X−μ_{x})(Y−μ_{y})]=E[XY]−μxμy$$
