## K Means

It is an algorithm under the section of unsupervised learning as it does not have labeled outputs. The goal is to group data with similar features in the form of clusters.
Applications include _Recommendation Engines, Image Segmentation_.

## Steps to follow for implenting kmeans:

- Decide how many clusters are needed which is given by k.
- $$\mu_{1} , \mu_{2}$$ centers are randomly initialised.
- Each point is assigned to it's closest cluster center.
- Each $$\mu_{j}$$ is updated with the mean of the points assigned to it.
