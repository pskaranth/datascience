I'm a Data Science and Machine Learning enthusiast who loves to learn various concepts related to it.

The content of this website are just notes that I made from the courses I took or the resources I read from and are no means a comprehensive overview. 

Most of the content in these posts are from :
* Micromasters in DataScience (_UCSD_) on edX
* DeepLearning(_Padhai OneFourthLabs_)
* Wikipedia/ youtube/ medium wherever I could get information from.


My goal is to understand the math behind machine learning algorithms and use it in a project which implements them from scratch using Python.\
This space will always be _WIP_ ..
