Goal: To implement Generative Model algorithm and to classify seed kernels.

About the dataset:
Measurements of geometrical properties of kernels belonging to three different varieties of wheat. 
A soft X-ray technique and GRAINS package were used to construct all seven, real-valued attributes.

Dataset from : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00236/seeds_dataset.txt

Number of errors varies based on the number of features used at each time.
Terms Univariate, BiVariate and MultiVariate denotes the number of features used at each time.

Some of the starter code used was from UCSD Micromaster's course from edX.
