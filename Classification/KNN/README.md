### KNN_MNIST.ipynb 
Goal: To implement K Nearest Neighbor algorithm from scratch. Hand written digits are identified using MNIST dataset.

About the dataset: 
MNIST is a classic dataset in machine learning, consisting of 28x28 gray-scale images handwritten digits. The original training set contains 60,000 examples and the test set contains 10,000 examples. In this notebook we will be working with a subset of this data: a training set of 7,500 examples and a test set of 1,000 examples.

This was part of UCSD Micromasters in Data Science course on Edx.
